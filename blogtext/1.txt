<h1>[28/08/2019] Cool new blog!</h1>
<p>So I got around to using a bit of Python to make this blog easy as pie to create. Nice and easy. I might improve it a bit and make it some nice FOSS(Free Open Source Software) for people to use.</p>
<p>So what kind of content do I plan for this blog? Really, what I'm interested in. It'll probably vary from talking about programming, game development, game design and all sorts. Maybe even some real world happenings. I don't know. I know I will try to make this a weekly blog. Seeing as this is just new technology I have constructed, I am making this a very short blog post. Why? Because I'm dead excited to put this technology to work on my site!</p>
<p>Onwards ho!-RisingThumb</p>
